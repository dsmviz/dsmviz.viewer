# Dsmviz viewer

General purpose DSM viewer based on https://dsmsuite.github.io/.

Aim:
- I want to focus my open source developement effort on DSM viewing, so source code analyzers are not included anymore. 
- Better usability
- Migrate to latest .Net technologies.

The current version is not yet stable. Stable versions will be released via https://dsmviz.github.io/ when available.

No new features will be developed for dsmsuite when dsmviz is available.
